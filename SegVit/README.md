This repository contains the official Pytorch implementation of training & evaluation code and the pretrained models for SegViT.

As shown in the following figure, the similarity between the class query and the image features is transfered to the segmentation mask.

## Highlights
* **Simple Decoder:** The Attention-to-Mask (ATM) decoder provides a simple segmentation head for Plain Vision Transformer, which is easy to extend to other downstream tasks.
* **Light Structure:** We proposed *Shrunk* structure that can save up to **40%** computational cost in a structure with ViT backbone.
* **Stronger performance:** We got state-of-the-art performance mIoU **55.2%** on ADE20K, mIoU **50.3%** on COCOStuff10K, and mIoU **65.3%** on PASCAL-Context datasets with the least amount of computational cost among counterparts using ViT backbone. 


## Getting started 

1. Install the [mmsegmentation](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation) library and some required packages.

```bash
pip install mmcv-full==1.4.4 mmsegmentation==0.24.0
pip install scipy timm
```
## Training
```
python tools/dist_train.sh  configs/segvit/segvit_vit-l_jax_640x640_160k_ade20k.py 
```
## Evaluation
```
python tools/dist_test.sh configs/segvit/segvit_vit-l_jax_640x640_160k_ade20k.py   {path_to_ckpt}
```

## Datasets
Please follow the instructions of [mmsegmentation](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation) data preparation
